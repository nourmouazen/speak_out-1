This website is basically built because the psychological health for people around the world is decreasing these days especially with Covid-19 Virus, so in order to make it easier on people and to make them feel more comfortable by first knowing their problems and then trying to find a way to heal. On the other hand, it would be a great opportunity for psychological doctors to know the problems that the society face these days, analyse these problems to come up with a good solution. It also gives them the chance to volunteer and help the people in need which will give them the feeling of satisfaction for being a better human being.
